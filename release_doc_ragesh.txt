2. **Project Overview**
   - Description of the web application to be deployed.
   - Overview of the DevOps process and tools used.

3. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - AWS services used: Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS Engine (MySQL),IAM,VPC,ELB,ASG,S3,Route 53
   - Terraform for IaC: Describe the infrastructure components defined in Terraform (VPC, subnets, security groups).
   
4. **Source Code Management**
   - Git repository hosted on GitHub.
   - https://github.com/rageshtamizharasu
   - Branching strategy: GitFlow.
   - Tags for release versions 1.0 or 1.*

5. **Continuous Integration**
   - Jenkins for CI/CD: Describe Jenkins job configuration for building, testing, and packaging the application.
   - Integration with GitHub hooks for automated builds Jenkinsfile.
   - Make sure to check the plugins
   
   node {
    stage('Checkout') {
        // Checkout the source code from your version control system (e.g., Git)
        checkout scm
    }

6. **Build and Packaging**
   - Maven for building Java-based application.
   - Describe the build process and Maven configuration.
   - mvn clean package

7. **Automated Testing**
   - Unit testing using JUnit and integration testing using Selenium.
   - using sonarQube 
   - Describe test suites and their integration into the CI/CD pipeline.

8. **Dockerization**
   - Dockerize the application for containerization.
   - Dockerfile and any necessary configuration files.
   - docker build -t myapplication /home/project/Dockerfile 

9. **Continuous Deployment**
   - AWS CodeDeploy for deployment automation.
   - Blue-green deployment strategy. v1 to v2
   - CodeDeploy hooks for pre and post-deployment actions.
  

10. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
    - Terraform for defining and managing infrastructure.
    - Explain Terraform configurations and modules for EC2 instances, RDS, etc.
	- terraform init , plan , apply

11. **Configuration Management**
    - Ansible for configuring EC2 instances.
    - Playbooks for installing dependencies and application setup.
	- ansible-playbook -i inventory my_playbook.yml

12. **Monitoring and Alerting**
    - AWS CloudWatch for monitoring resources and application metrics.
    - Prometheus and Grafana for advanced monitoring and visualization.
	-./node_exporter & Port number of Node_Exporter-->9100
    - Define metrics, alerts, and dashboards.

13. **Log Management**
    - Splunk for log aggregation and analysis.
    - Explain how application logs are collected and forwarded to Splunk.
	-./splunk start --accept-license
	-./splunk add forward-server publicip:9997
	-./splunk add monitor /var/log/syslog -index main -sourcetype slave1logs  - example
	

14. **Security and Compliance**
    - IAM roles for EC2 instances with least privilege.
    - Encryption at rest and in transit.
    - Compliance considerations and their implementation.

15. **Release Process**
    - Document the complete release process from code commit to production deployment.
    - Include integration points and communication channels.

16. **Rollback Strategy**
    - Detail the process of rolling back a release in case of issues.
	- Backup: Before deploying any changes, take backups of databases, configurations, and relevant data. This provides a recovery point in case of issues.
    - Steps for reverting code, database changes, and infrastructure.

17. **Conclusion**
    - Summarize the key points of the document.
    - Emphasize the benefits of using AWS services and DevOps tools.

18. **Appendices**
    - Include diagrams, sample code snippets, and references.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive example of integrating various AWS services and DevOps tools into a real-world application deployment process.
